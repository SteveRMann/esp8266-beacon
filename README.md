# esp8266-beacon
This is a simple PCB that combines an ESP8266-01 and a buck voltage converter. The ESP is expected to be socketed and lays over the voltage converter.
The voltage converter is an adjustable device set for 3.3V.
The ESPHome code simply connects to the local WiFi when in range.
The project came about because I connected my garage door opener to Alexa and I wanted to not let the doors open if the associated vehicle was not in WiFi range.
